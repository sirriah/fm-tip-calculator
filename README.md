## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) - For styles


### What I learned

This is my first time with ReactJS. I started the course of Max Schwarzmüller from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/). I was in the third of this course, when I start this challenge and I wanted to try, if I can finished this challenge. 

I used the Create React app and CSS Modules.

What I have leart in CSS is, that for the hover on input is better to use the outline than the border, because border cause "jumping" of the rest of the content.

Accessibility is the really importnat part for me, but I am still learning :)

### Continued development

I want to finished the React course and then I want to try next challenge from Fronted Mentor - the memory game.


### Useful resources

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - s a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.
- [Udemy course ReactJS](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) by Max Schwarzmüller
